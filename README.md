# Social Manager

## 📌 Overview
**Social Manager** is an RPA-based application developed using **UiPath** that automates Instagram posting and engagement tracking. This project simplifies social media management by automatically uploading posts and collecting performance metrics (such as the number of likes) for every photo on your profile.

## ✨ Features
- 📸 **Automated Instagram Posting** – Uploads images with captions automatically.
- 📊 **Engagement Tracking** – Fetches the number of likes for each post on your profile.
- ⚡ **RPA-Driven Automation** – Uses UiPath's capabilities to interact with Instagram seamlessly.
- 🔄 **Scheduled Execution** – Can be scheduled to run at predefined intervals.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **UiPath** – For robotic process automation (RPA).
- **Excel / CSV** – Stores and organizes collected engagement data.

## 📊 How It Works
1. The bot logs into your Instagram account.
2. It uploads a predefined photo with a caption.
3. It retrieves engagement data (number of likes) for all profile posts.
4. The collected data is saved in an Excel/CSV file for further analysis.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Considerations
- Instagram’s policies on automation should be followed to avoid account restrictions.
- The bot operates through web automation and may need adjustments if Instagram’s UI changes.
- Ensure a stable internet connection for seamless execution.
